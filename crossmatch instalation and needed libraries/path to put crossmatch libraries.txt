First install rpy2 into conda with:
conda install -c r rpy2
the run the code to install crossmatch  on the notebook named:
 Python_R_package_script.ipynb
Then, this is the usual path where the libraries for R will be contained and here is where we need to manually put the libraries for crossmatch to work.
C:\Users\Eric Aragundi\anaconda\Lib\R\library
